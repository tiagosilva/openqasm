# OpenQASM

Specs, examples and tools for the OpenQASM intermediate representation.

## Current version

The latest version is: __2.0__.

## About this project

On this repository you'll find all the documentation related to OpenQASM and some useful OpenQASM examples.

### Language specs

The language documentation is available [here](spec/qasm2.rst).

### Examples

The examples can be found under the [examples](examples) folder.

They are OpenQASM files, i.e.:

```text
// Repetition code syndrome measurement
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[3];
qreg a[2];
creg c[3];
creg syn[2];
gate syndrome d1,d2,d3,a1,a2
{
  cx d1,a1; cx d2,a1;
  cx d2,a2; cx d3,a2;
}
x q[0]; // error
barrier q;
syndrome q[0],q[1],q[2],a[0],a[1];
measure a -> syn;
if(syn==1) x q[0];
if(syn==2) x q[2];
if(syn==3) x q[1];
measure q -> c;
```

## Tests
